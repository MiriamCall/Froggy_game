# Overview

The game I wrote is similar to the game Frogger. This game features a frog that is trying to navigate its way to the other side of the screen. There are busses that are passing and if hit, the frog starts again.

I wrote this software to learn more about writing games. I wanted to know how people design games and how intensive the code can be for that.

# Development Environment

To create this game I used VS code to build it.

The language I built it in was python. Python is a very popular language that a lot of people learn as they are starting to code.
