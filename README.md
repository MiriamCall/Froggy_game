# Overview

The game I wrote is similar to the game Frogger. This game features a frog that is trying to navigate its way to the other side of the screen. There are busses that are passing and if hit, the frog starts again.

I wrote this software to learn more about writing games. I wanted to know how people design games and how intensive the code can be for that.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

To create this game I used VS code to build it.

The language I built it in was python. Python is a very popular language that a lot of people learn as they are starting to code.

# Future Work

- The background could have an image of a road put into it
- I could add cars coming from both directions to increase difficulty
- The graphics could br improved in the future
